# appgraph

AppGraph is a language & framework for expressing an entire web application as a graph of interconnected agentic nodes. Nodes can encapsulate behaviors as complex as a full microservice, and leverages generative AI to perform complex, fully agentic workloads without needing to write any code.

AppGraph takes care of platform, framework, infrastructure, scaling, security & networking needs. Begin with a prompt of what you want the application to do. AppGraph produces a JSON representation of a system graph describing how each component should behave & interact. Refine the graph as needed for your use case, and let AppGraph build out & deploy the entire application. The graph is the source of truth - make changes as needed, and AppGraph keeps the service in sync with the specification.
