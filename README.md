# appgraph

AppGraph is a language & framework for expressing an entire web application as a graph of interconnected agentic nodes. Nodes can encapsulate behaviors as complex as a full microservice, and leverages generative AI to perform complex, fully agentic workloads without needing to write any code.

AppGraph takes care of all platform, framework, infrastructure, scaling, & networking concerns. Begin with a prompt of what you want the application to do. AppGraph produces a JSON representation of a system graph describing what each component should do and how they interact. Refine the graph as needed for your use case, and let AppGraph build out the entire system. The graph becomes the source of truth - make changes as needed, and AppGraph keeps the service in sync with the specification.
